PicturEci is based on the game "Pictionary" and other similar online,
The game will have the classic modes of competing with a limited time, and words by category, etc ...
The added value of the project lies in a new gameplay that will test the ability to concentrate and
Multitasking of the players, since in addition to a player draws the object that was requested,
In simultaneous also must guess what the other player is drawing,
Ie the two players will have to draw and guess the other player's drawing at the same time! .
And as if that were not enough, will have extreme mode in which randomly any of the strokes of players will be erased,
Thus generating greater difficulty.
